* When you declare a global JavaScript variable, what you are actually doing is defining
* a property of the global object (ยง3.5). If you use var to declare the variable, 
* the property that is created is nonconfigurable (see ยง6.7), which means that it
*  cannot be deleted with the delete operator.
